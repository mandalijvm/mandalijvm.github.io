### Header 3 -->
**Mandali** is a Java library designed to detect potential thread safety issues within Java classes. 

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/mandalijvm/mandalijvm.github.io/blob/main/log.png?raw=true"/>

This library helps identify the use of collections that may not be thread-safe in multi-threaded environments and automatically detects deadlocks when running.


<!-- Features
--------

* *Unsafe-thread Data Structure Detection*

  Mandali can identify commonly Unsafe-thread Data Structure in multi-threaded contexts, such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `StringBuilder`.

* *Thread-safe Alternatives Recommendation*

  This feature suggests safer alternatives to replace unsafe collections or objects, enhancing the application's thread safety.

* *Deadlock Detection*

  Mandali automatically detects deadlocks in the system and provides detailed information on locked threads.

Why do we need a Mandali
------------------------

* *Early Problem Detection*

  Mandali proactively identifies unsafe data collections for multi-threading operations, helping to avoid unpredictable program behavior due to thread safety issues.

* *Improved Code Quality*

  By using Mandali, you can enhance code quality, making it more stable, reliable, and maintainable.

* *Development Efficiency*

  Mandali saves time by automatically detecting issues, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of debugging concurrency problems.

* *Ease of Use*

  - *Easy Integration*

    Mandali can be easily integrated into your project by adding it to the project dependencies.

  - *Clear Reporting*

    The reports generated by Mandali are easy to understand, even for developers not deeply familiar with concurrency concepts. -->

Note: **This is not to guarantee thread safety. It just helps reduce potential thread safety issues**.


## Installation
### In Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/hangga/repo' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.mandali:mandali:1.0.10-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
### In Maven
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>mandali-repo</id>
        <url>https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/hangga/repo</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.mandali</groupId>
        <artifactId>mandali</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.10-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Basic Usage
To start the Mandali analysis, simply create an instance of Mandali and call start() on it:
```Kotlin
Mandali(this).start()
```

## Annotation Usage: @RunMandali
This annotation should be applied at the class level of a test to trigger the analysis based on the specified options:


| Param          |descriptions| type              | default |
|:---------------|:---------------|:------------------|:--------|
| showDate       | A Boolean parameter that, when set to true, displays the date and time of the analysis run in the output.| boolean | true    |
| detectDeadlock | A Boolean parameter that enables deadlock detection|boolean   | false    |


```Kotlin
// Add annotation here
@RunMandali(showDate = true, detectDeadlock = true)
class MandaliExampleUnitTest {
    // Test cases
}
```

## Example Test Class
The following example demonstrates how to structure a test class to check for thread safety issues using the Mandali library. This class simulates potential deadlocks and thread-unsafe scenarios, which are detected and analyzed by Mandali.

```Kotlin
package io.mandali

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import java.lang.Thread.sleep
import kotlin.concurrent.thread

class Account(val name: String, var balance: Int) {

    private fun deposit(amount: Int) {
        balance += amount
    }

    private fun withdraw(amount: Int) {
        balance -= amount
    }

    fun transfer(to: Account, amount: Int) {
        println("${this.name} tries to transfer $amount to ${to.name}.")
        synchronized(this) {
            sleep(10) // Simulate processing time
            if (balance >= amount) {
                withdraw(amount)
                synchronized(to) {
                    to.deposit(amount)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

@RunMandali(showDate = true, detectDeadlock = true)
class MandaliExampleKotlinUnitTest {

    @Test
    fun `example of deadlock`() {
        val account1 = Account("Hangga", 1000)
        val account2 = Account("John", 1000)
        val account3 = Account("Alice", 2000)

        // Transfer from account1 to account2
        thread {
            account1.transfer(account2, 100)
        }.join(10) // as a simulation of the time required

        // Transfer from account2 to account1
        thread {
            account2.transfer(account1, 200)
        }.join(20)

        // Transfer from account3 to account1
        thread {
            account3.transfer(account1, 1000)
        }.join(500)

        Mandali(this).start()
    }

    val list = ArrayList()

    @Test
    fun `example thread-unsafe using HashMap`() {
        val map = HashMap()

        val threads = List(10) { index ->
            thread {
                for (i in 0 until 1000) {
                    map[i] = index
                }
            }
        }

        threads.forEach {
            it.join()
        }
    }
}
```
